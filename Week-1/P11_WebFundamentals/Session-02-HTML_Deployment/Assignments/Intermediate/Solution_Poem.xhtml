      I'm Nobody! Who are you?<br />
      Are you - Nobody - Too? <br />Then there's a pair of us!<br />
      Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      How dreary - to be - Somebody!<br />How public- like a Frog <br />
      To tell one's name - the live long <br />
      June To an admiring Bog! <br />
